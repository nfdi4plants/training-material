Done!

✔︎ I've created an ARC for my project\
✔︎ I've added metadata about the overall investigation\
✔︎ I've added a study for my samples

</Viola>

In your file system, your ARC should look similar to this: 

```bash
|- isa.investigation.xlsx
|- studies/
|   |- AthalianaColdStress/
|   |   |- READMDE.md
|   |   |- isa.study.xlsx
|   |   |- protocols/
|   |   |   |- growth_protocol.md
|   |   |- resources/
|- assays/
|- workflows/
|- runs/
```
