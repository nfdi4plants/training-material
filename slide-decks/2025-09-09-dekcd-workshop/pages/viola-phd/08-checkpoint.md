✔︎ I’ve added measurement data as an assay\
✔︎ I’ve uploaded my ARC to the DataHUB to have a version-controlled save copy.\
✔︎ I’ve shared the ARC with colleagues, so they can explore my findings and contribute.

In your file system, your ARC should look similar to this: 
```bash
|- isa.investigation.xlsx
|- studies/
|   |- AthalianaColdStress/
|   |   |- ...
|- assays/
|   |- SugarMeasurement
|   |   |- README.md
|   |   |- isa.assay.xlsx
|   |   |- dataset
|   |   |   |- sugar_result.csv
|   |   |- protocols
|   |   |   |- sugar_extraction_protocol.md
|- workflows/
|- runs/
```
