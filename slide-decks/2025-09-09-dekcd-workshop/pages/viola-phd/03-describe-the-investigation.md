    Now that I have an ARC, I want to add my data. The investigation file seems to be the most top level. Let's start there!

        At the <b>investigation</b> level you can record project metadata such as the project title and description, responsible contacts and associated publications.

    I am working on <i>cold acclimation of Arabidopsis Thaliana</i> by <i>investigating the response of Arabidopsis thaliana to cold stress by subjecting plants to low-temperature conditions and monitoring physiological, molecular, and growth-related changes. Cold-treated plants are compared with control groups grown under optimal conditions to assess stress-related markers such as changes in protein abundance, sugar content, and growth rates. The goal is to identify key molecules and physiological responses involved in cold tolerance, contributing to the understanding of plant stress adaptation mechanisms</i>. The experiment involves my PI <i>Prof. Jasmine Beetroot</i>, our collaboration partner <i>Oliver Sage</i> and myself, <i>Viola Canina</i>.

<Solution>

1. Click on the ARC's name (e.g. `AthalianaColdStressSugar`) on the top of the file tree.
1. **Add a Title:** Arabidopsis Thaliana cold acclimation
1. **Add a Description:** This experiment investigates the response of Arabidopsis thaliana to cold stress by subjecting plants to low-temperature conditions and monitoring physiological, molecular, and growth-related changes. Cold-treated plants are compared with control groups grown under optimal conditions to assess stress-related markers such as changes in protein abundance, sugar content, and growth rates. The goal is to identify key molecules and physiological responses involved in cold tolerance, contributing to the understanding of plant stress adaptation mechanisms.
