    For my PhD I investigate the effect of cold stress on sugar metabolism in <i>A. thaliana</i>. I grew the plants under ambient (25 °C) and cold stress (6 °C) conditions, harvested leaves from a two-day time series experiment, extracted proteins and soluble sugars. I submitted the protein samples to a nearby core facility for proteomics. After a few weeks of iterative consultation with the facility head as well as technicians and computational biologists, I received back a wealth of raw and processed data. The extracted sugars I measured myself via a plate reader assay. From the data I produced figures using a mix of code and statistical software. Now I want to wrap everything up to publish the results in the <i>Journal of Wonderful Plant Sciences</i>.
